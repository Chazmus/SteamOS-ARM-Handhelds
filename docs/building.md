# Building

I build everything in an arm64 Linux VM (Colima on a Mac).

- Kernels: `external-and-mods/kernel-sm8650/build.sh` and `external-and-mods/kernel-sm8550/build.sh` (shared script in `kernel-common/`, chip specific bits in each `soc.env`)
- gamescope: `scripts/build-gamescope-in-rootfs.sh`, source in `external-and-mods/gamescope/`
- the image: `make-steamos-sm8650.sh` (`SOC=sm8550` for the 8 Gen 2 one)

Valve's files and the Steam client aren't in this repo, the build downloads them. How the pieces fit together is in [HOW-IT-WORKS.md](HOW-IT-WORKS.md).
